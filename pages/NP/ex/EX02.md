### 🧪 **Exercise: Creating NumPy Arrays**

#### 💡 **Objective:**

Learn and practice creating NumPy arrays using various methods.

#### 📚 **Instructions:**

Complete each of the following tasks using NumPy. Write your code below each question and observe the results using `print()`.

---

### 📝 **Tasks**

1. **Import NumPy**
   Import the NumPy library using the alias `np`.

2. **From a List**
   Create a 1D array from the list `[5, 10, 15, 20, 25]`.

3. **Array of Zeros**
   Create a 2x4 array filled with zeros.

4. **Array of Ones**
   Create a 3x3 array filled with ones.

5. **Array with a Range of Values**
   Create an array with values from 10 to 50 (inclusive) with a step of 5.

6. **Evenly Spaced Values (linspace)**
   Create an array of 5 values equally spaced between 0 and 1.

7. **Identity Matrix**
   Create a 4x4 identity matrix.

8. **Random Integer Array**
   Create a 2x3 array of random integers between 1 and 100.

9. **Reshape a 1D Array**
   Create a 1D array of values from 1 to 12 and reshape it into a 3x4 matrix.

10. **Check Shape and Data Type**
    Print the shape and data type of the array created in question 9.
