1. Create a program that takes two numbers and a mathematical operator (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) as input from the user.  
2. Perform the corresponding operation and print the result.

---

### **Exercise 10: Area of a Circle**
1. Write a program to calculate the area of a circle.

3. Use `math.pi` for the value of π.

---

### **Exercise 11: Using Input**
1. Ask the user for their name and age.  
2. Print a message saying how old they will be in 10 years.

---

### **Exercise 12: Type Conversion**
1. Ask the user to input a number.  
2. Convert the input to an integer, float, and string.  
3. Print the value and type for each conversion.

---

### **Exercise 13: Temperature Conversion**
1. Write a program that converts a temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit.  
   Formula: `F = (C * 9/5) + 32`
2. Test the program with several inputs.

---

### **Exercise 14: BMI Calculator**
1. Write a program to calculate BMI using the formula:  
   `BMI = weight (kg) / (height (m) ** 2)`
2. Ask the user for their weight and height, then calculate and print their BMI.

---

### **Exercise 15: Bitwise Operators**
1. Write a program to perform the following bitwise operations:
   - AND (`&`)
   - OR (`|`)
   - XOR (`^`)
   - Left Shift (`<<`)
   - Right Shift (`>>`)  

   Use two numbers (e.g., `5` and `3`) for the operations.
