### **Fundamental Data Types**

#### **Solution 1: Identify Data Types**
```python
x = 42
y = 3.14
z = "Python"
is_active = True
balance = None

print(type(x))        # <class 'int'>
print(type(y))        # <class 'float'>
print(type(z))        # <class 'str'>
print(type(is_active)) # <class 'bool'>
print(type(balance))   # <class 'NoneType'>
```

---

#### **Solution 2: Type Casting**
```python
# Type Casting
integer_to_float = float(10)
float_to_integer = int(9.8)
string_to_integer = int("42")
boolean_to_integer = int(True)

print(type(integer_to_float), integer_to_float)  # <class 'float'> 10.0
print(type(float_to_integer), float_to_integer)  # <class 'int'> 9
print(type(string_to_integer), string_to_integer) # <class 'int'> 42
print(type(boolean_to_integer), boolean_to_integer) # <class 'int'> 1
```

---

#### **Solution 3: Arithmetic Operations on Strings**
```python
user_input = input("Enter a string: ")

# Repeat the string
print(user_input * 3)

# Concatenate the string

print(new_string)
```

---

### **Collection Data Types**

#### **Solution 4: List Operations**
```python
# List of fruits
fruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Mango", "Cherry", "Orange"]

# Add a new fruit
fruits.append("Grapes")

# Try modifying (will raise an error)
try:
    cities[1] = "London"
except TypeError as e:
    print(e)  # 'tuple' object does not support item assignment

# Convert to list, modify, and convert back to tuple

cities_list[1] = "London"
cities = tuple(cities_list)
print(cities)
```

---
