## Here are **practice exercises** focused on **Repetitive Structures** (loops) in Python:

---

### **Basic Loop Exercises**

#### **Exercise 1: Print Numbers**
Write a program to print numbers from 1 to 10 using a `for` loop.

---

#### **Exercise 2: Sum of Numbers**
Write a program to calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to `n`, where `n` is provided by the user.

---

#### **Exercise 3: Multiplication Table**
Write a program to display the multiplication table of a number input by the user.

---

#### **Exercise 4: Factorial**
Write a program to calculate the factorial of a given number using a `for` loop.

---

#### **Exercise 5: Countdown Timer**
Write a program that counts down from 10 to 1 and then prints "Blast Off!" using a `while` loop.

---

### **Intermediate Loop Exercises**

#### **Exercise 6: Reverse a String**
Write a program to reverse a string input by the user using a loop.

---

#### **Exercise 7: Sum of Digits**
Write a program to calculate the sum of digits of a number input by the user.  
For example, if the input is `123`, the output should be `6`.

---

#### **Exercise 8: Fibonacci Series**
Write a program to print the first `n` terms of the Fibonacci sequence, where `n` is provided by the user.

---

#### **Exercise 9: Nested Loop: Pattern Printing**
Write a program to print the following pattern:
```
*
**
***
****
*****
```

---

#### **Exercise 10: Find Prime Numbers**
Write a program to print all prime numbers between 1 and `n`, where `n` is provided by the user.

---

### **Advanced Loop Exercises**

#### **Exercise 11: Number Guessing Game**
Write a number guessing game:
1. The program generates a random number between 1 and 100.
2. The user has unlimited attempts to guess the number.
3. The program provides hints like "Too High" or "Too Low."

---

#### **Exercise 12: Collatz Conjecture**
Write a program to implement the Collatz conjecture:
1. Start with a number `n` input by the user.
2. If `n` is even, divide it by 2; if odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1.
3. Repeat until `n` becomes 1, and print all the intermediate steps.

---

#### **Exercise 13: Palindrome Check**
Write a program to check if a string is a palindrome using a loop.

---

#### **Exercise 14: Armstrong Numbers**
Write a program to check if a given number is an Armstrong number.  
An Armstrong number for a 3-digit number is one where:
\[ n = a^3 + b^3 + c^3 \]  
(e.g., `153 = 1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3`).

---

#### **Exercise 15: Pyramid Pattern**
Write a program to print the following pyramid pattern:
```
    *
   ***
  *****
 *******
*********
```

---

### **Loop Control Exercises**

#### **Exercise 16: Skip Multiples**
Write a program that prints numbers from 1 to 20 but skips numbers that are multiples of 3.

---

#### **Exercise 17: Infinite Loop Detection**
Write a program that enters an infinite loop but breaks when the user enters a specific word (e.g., `"stop"`).

---

#### **Exercise 18: Sum Until Zero**
Write a program that repeatedly takes input from the user and adds it to a sum.  
The program stops and prints the total when the user enters `0`.

---

#### **Exercise 19: Guessing a Password**
Write a program that keeps asking the user to guess a predefined password.  
The program continues until the correct password is entered.

---

#### **Exercise 20: Finding Maximum**
Write a program that takes a series of numbers as input from the user.  
The program stops when the user enters `-1` and prints the maximum number entered.
